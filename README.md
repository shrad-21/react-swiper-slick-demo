# react-swiper-slick-demo

Project Introduction:
I developed a multi-page React website that integrates advanced UI components and dynamic data fetching. The project includes both a custom Swiper slider and a React Slick slider to create engaging, responsive carousels. Data is fetched from APIs and displayed in a structured way, providing both a list view for quick browsing and a detail page for in-depth product or content information. This approach ensures smooth navigation, interactivity, and a user-friendly experience across devices.

Key Features:

Custom Swiper slider and React Slick slider for responsive carousels.

API integration to fetch and display real-time data.

List and detail pages for structured content presentation.

Mobile-first, responsive design for seamless performance.
